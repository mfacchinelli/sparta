/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Compute grid mixture ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Number of groups in compute tvib/grid mixture has changed

This mixture property cannot be changed after this compute command is
issued.

E: Number of species in compute tvib/grid mixture has changed

This mixture property cannot be changed after this compute command is
issued.
